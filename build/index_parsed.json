This increase in downwash means that for the same geometric angle of attack, the **effective angle of attack decreases** (the angle between the chord line and the relative airflow is now smaller).

To maintain a constant **Calibrated Airspeed (CAS)**, the **True Airspeed (TAS)** must increase (since TAS is inversely proportional to the square root of density). Since TAS increases and the **Local Speed of Sound (LSS)** decreases (due to falling temperature), the **Mach Number** ($M = \\frac{TAS}{LSS}$) will also increase.
