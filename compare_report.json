The primary method to combat this is to consciously slow down the breathing rate and reduce the depth of breaths to allow $CO_2$ levels to return to normal. While checking oxygen equipment is a good precaution to rule out hypoxia, the specific remedy for hyperventilation is controlling respiration."

When TODR increases, the safe maximum Take-Off Mass (TOM) must be **decreased** to ensure the aircraft can stop or go within the available field length. While upslope technically reduces the energy absorbed by the brakes in an RTO (allowing for a higher VMBE speed), the overall performance limitation usually shifts back to the required field length, which is negatively affected by the slope.",

          "answer": "require a decrease in the mass",
          "explanation": "For ATPL performance questions, an **increase in uphill slope** generally increases the **Take-Off Distance Required (TODR)** because a component of gravity opposes acceleration. When TODR increases, the safe maximum Take-Off Mass (TOM) must be **decreased** to ensure the aircraft can stop or go within the available field length. While upslope technically reduces the energy absorbed by the brakes in an RTO (allowing for a higher VMBE speed), the overall performance limitation usually shifts back to the required field length, which is negatively affected by the slope.",
