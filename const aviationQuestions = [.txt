    question: "What is the primary purpose of the flaps on an airplane?",
    options: {
      A: "To increase lift and drag to allow for steeper approaches and slower landing speeds.",
      B: "To decrease drag and increase lift for higher cruising speeds.",
      C: "To increase lateral stability during turns."
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "Extending flaps increases the camber of the wing, which increases both lift and drag. This allows the aircraft to descend at a steeper angle without increasing airspeed.",
    figure: null // Use a string like "Figure 4" if an image is required

    question: "Which V-speed represents maneuvering speed?",
    options: {
      A: "Vne",
      B: "Va",
      C: "Vno"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Va is the design maneuvering speed. Do not use full or abrupt control movements above this speed.",
