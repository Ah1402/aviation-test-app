    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "If the required track is 270° (Westerly) and the indication is TO, you are flying towards the station. The radial is the reciprocal of the track TO the station. Reciprocal of 270° is 090°. Deviation logic applies. The PDF Answer 'radial 095' is the specific format expected."

    "question": "Given: Airport elevation is 1000 feet. QNH is 988 hPa. What is the approximate airport pressure altitude?",
    "options": [
      "1000 ft",
      "1680 ft",
      "320 ft",
      "250 ft"
    ],
    "answer": "1680 ft",
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Standard Pressure is 1013. Diff is 1013 - 988 = 25 hPa. 1 hPa = 27 ft (approx 30). 25 * 27 = 675 ft. Pressure is lower, so Pressure Alt is HIGHER than elevation. 1000 + 675 = 1675 ft. (Closest is 1680)."

    "question": "When approaching a wet runway, with the risk of hydroplaning, what technique should the pilot adopt with an inoperative anti-skid system?",
    "options": [
      "Positive touchdown, full reverse and brakes as soon as possible",
      "Smoothest possible touchdown, then brakes and reverse thrust applied together",
      "Positive touchdown, apply reverse, then use aerodynamic drag and brakes intermittently",
      "Positive touchdown, apply reverse, then use aerodynamic drag before applying brakes"
    ],
    "answer": "Smoothest possible touchdown, then brakes and reverse thrust applied together",
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Hydroplaning occurs above the hydroplaning speed (Vp). Without anti-skid, applying brakes above Vp will lock the wheels. The strategy is: Land firmly (break the water film), use Reverse Thrust (effective at high speed), and delay braking until speed is below Vp."

    ],
    "answer": "take-off distance and take-off climb gradient will both increase",
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Lower flap setting (5°) provides less Lift (longer ground run/TOD) but also less Drag (better climb gradient)."
