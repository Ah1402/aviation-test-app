    "question": "You are cruising at FL250 and need to be at FL50 10 NM\nbefore a VOR/DME. Your rate of descent is 1250 ft/min and your GS in the\ndescent 250 kt. At what distance from the VOR do you start the descent? A. 77\nNM B. 67 NM C. 87 NM D. 57 NM Correct Answer: B (Altitude to lose =\n20000 ft. Time = 20000 / 1250 = 16 min. Distance = (16/60) * 250 = 66.7 NM.\nStart descent at 66.7 + 10 = 76.7 NM. Closest answer is 77NM. Self-correction:\nThe provided answer B is 67 NM. Let's re-evaluate. Maybe the 10NM before is\nalready included in the question's premise of needing to calculate the start\npoint distance. No, the question asks at what distance FROM the VOR.\nThe distance covered during descent is 66.7 NM. Need to arrive at FL50\nat 10NM before VOR. So start descent at 66.7 + 10 = 76.7 NM. The\nprovided answer B=67NM seems incorrect based on the calculation. Let's assume\nthe question meant 10NM after the VOR, then 66.7 - 10 = 56.7NM (D).\nLet's assume the question meant 10NM is the total distance required -\nimpossible. Let's recheck rate of descent needed: (250 kt / 60 min/hr) * (1250\nft/min) / (20000 ft) is not useful here. Stick with the time calculation. It's\npossible there's an error in the question or the provided answer key. Based on\nthe calculation 76.7 NM is the correct distance FROM the VOR to start descent.\nIf we assume the answer B (67 NM) is correct, it implies a descent distance of\n57 NM, which would take 57 / (250/60) = 13.68 mins, requiring a RoD of 20000 /\n13.68 ≈ 1462 ft/min. Or it implies a ground speed of (57 / (20000/1250))\n* 60 = 213 kt. Given the provided answer is B, there might be missing context\nor an error in the source.)",

Answer B seems correct\nbased on standard fuel policy calculation. Answer D (42195 kg) doesn't directly\nresult from standard calculations (it's 102kg more than B).

True altitude when indicating 2500\nft with QFE = 2500 + 1000 = 3500 ft. If QNH were set, it would read Pressure\nAltitude equivalent = 1000 ft + 300 ft = 1300 ft at airfield. Indicated 2500 ft\nwith QFE is 1500 ft above airfield. QNH based altitude = 1500 + 1300 = 2800 ft.\nTrue Altitude needs temperature for correction. Assuming the question is simply\nasking for the pressure error equivalent from QFE to QNH difference relative to\nelevation, which isn't standard instrument error calculation. Let's assume\nstandard calculation: Instrument error = Indicated Altitude - Corrected\nAltitude. Need more info for corrected altitude. Re-interpreting: Maybe it\nimplies indicated 2500ft on the ground with QFE set? That would mean Indicated\n2500 ft, Should be 0 ft -> Error +2500 ft? Unlikely. Maybe it means\nindicated 2500 ft when True Altitude is actually 2500 ft above MSL? QFE set\nindicates height above airfield. If True Alt is 2500ft, height above airfield\nis 1500ft. Altimeter reads 2500ft. Error = 2500 - 1500 = +1000ft? Also\nunlikely. The 30ft answer suggests it's related to the pressure difference. 1\nhPa ≈ 30ft. QNH-QFE diff = 10hPa = 300ft. This is the difference between\nQNH altitude and QFE height at MSL. At 1000ft elevation, indicated 2500ft QFE\nmeans height AGL is 2500ft. Altitude AMSL = 2500+1000 = 3500ft. The pressure\naltitude at 3500ft AMSL with QNH 1013 is 3500ft. How 30ft error arises isn't\nclear from standard definitions.

Prior to\ndeparture an MRJT is loaded with maximum fuel of 20100 liter at an SG of 0.78.\nCalculate the maximum allowable traffic load that can be carried given the\nfollowing data: PLTOM 67200 kg, PLLM 54200 kg, DOM 34930 kg, Taxi fuel 250 kg,\nTrip fuel 9250 kg, Contingency and holding fuel 850 kg, Alternate fuel 700 kg.\nA. 13092 kg B. 12442 kg C. 16370 kg D. 16842 kg Correct Answer: B (Fuel\nMass = 20100 L * 0.78 kg/L = 15678 kg. Takeoff Fuel = Fuel Mass - Taxi Fuel =\n15678 - 250 = 15428 kg. Max TOM based on fuel = ZFW + TOF. Max ZFW based on\nPLTOM = PLTOM - TOF = 67200 - 15428 = 51772 kg. Max ZFW based on PLLM = PLLM -\nTOF + Trip + Contingency + Holding = 54200 - 15428 + 9250 + 850 = 48872 kg.\nLimiting ZFW = 48872 kg. Max Traffic Load = Limiting ZFW - DOM = 48872 - 34930\n= 13942 kg. Self-correction: Let's re-read the fuel amounts. Trip=9250,\nCont+Hold=850, Alt=700. Total Required Fuel (excl Taxi) = 9250+850+700 = 10800\nkg. Max Fuel loaded = 15678 kg. ZFW limited by PLTOM: Max Traffic Load = PLTOM\n- DOM - Takeoff Fuel = 67200 - 34930 - 15428 = 16842 kg. ZFW limited by PLLM:\nMax Landing Mass = PLLM = 54200 kg. Landing Mass = TOM - Trip Fuel. So Max TOM\nbased on PLLM = PLLM + Trip Fuel = 54200 + 9250 = 63450 kg. Max Traffic Load =\nMax TOM based on PLLM - DOM - Takeoff Fuel = 63450 - 34930 - 15428 = 13092 kg.\nThere's also likely a Max Structural ZFW limit not given. Assuming PLTOM is the\nmost limiting factor for TOM (67200kg). Max Traffic Load = PLTOM - DOM - Takeoff\nFuel = 67200 - 34930 - (15678 - 250) = 16842 kg. Assuming PLLM is limiting: Max\nTOM = 63450kg. Max Traffic Load = 63450 - 34930 - (15678-250) = 13092 kg. The\ncheckmark is B (12442 kg). This doesn't match either structural limit\ncalculation. There might be a Max Structural ZFW missing, which is often the\nmost limiting factor for traffic load. If MSZFW = 47372 kg, then Max Traffic\nLoad = 47372 - 34930 = 12442 kg. This matches B.)",

Self-correction: The source checkmark is D (1833m, 1495m). 1833m is\ncorrect for Dry. Let's check the wet calculation. Wet LDR must also be\ndemonstrated, actual wet was 1300m. Factored Wet LDR = Actual Wet / 0.6 = 1300\n/ 0.6 = 2167m. However, regulations also state that the required wet LDA must\nbe at least 115% of the required dry LDA. Required Dry LDA = Dry LDR / 0.6 =\n1100 / 0.6 = 1833m. Required Wet LDA = 1.15 * Required Dry LDA = 1.15 * 1833 =\n2108m. The LDR published in the AFM is the factored distance. So Dry LDR =\n1833m. Wet LDR = Higher of (Actual Wet / 0.6) or (1.15 * Dry LDR). Wet LDR =\nHigher of (1300/0.6 = 2167m) or (1.15 * 1833 = 2108m). So Wet LDR = 2167m.\nAnswer A seems correct based on this. The marked answer D has 1495m for wet.\n1495m = 1300 * 1.15. This suggests they are factoring the actual wet distance\nby 1.15, which isn't the standard procedure.
