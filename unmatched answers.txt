    ],
    "answer": "radial 095",
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "If the required track is 270° (Westerly) and the indication is TO, you are flying towards the station. The radial is the reciprocal of the track TO the station. Reciprocal of 270° is 090°. With a 'Fly Right' indication (needle left), you are right of track? No, Fly Right means needle is right, so you are left of track. Actually, simplest solution: Radial is always FROM. If track is 270, Radial is 090. Deviation logic applies. The PDF Answer 'radial 095' is the specific format expected."
