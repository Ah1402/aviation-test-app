    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This refers to the 'Approach Ban'. If the reported RVR is below minima *before* passing the Outer Marker (or equivalent point like 1000ft), you must not continue the approach. If it drops *after* this point, you may continue to DA/H."

    "answer": "arrival equal to or better than the minimum conditions required for aerodrome use",
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The standard ICAO/EASA rule is that the destination and alternate must be forecast to be at or above minima at the *predicted time of arrival*. The 'reasonable time before and after' clause typically applies to *VFR* flights or specific operator requirements, but the core IFR rule focuses on the ETA."

    "explanation": "This question format (statements 1 & 4) implies a multiple-choice structure where options combine statements. 1. Higher mass requires more downforce to rotate, increasing stick force. 4. Higher mass requires more lift, increasing stall speed. Gliding range (L/D max) is independent of mass (though speed to fly it changes)."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Deceleration causes the bottom of the gyro (which is pendulous) to swing forward. This precesses to a tilt (showing a turn) and a pitch down indication. For a standard air-driven horizon, deceleration typically indicates a *descending turn to the left* (assuming clockwise rotor rotation)."

    "answer": "Flight in severe turbulence may lead to a stall and/or structural limitations being exceeded.",
