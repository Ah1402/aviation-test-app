The question might be asking for the scale relative to 30S. Scale factor is 1 at standard parallels. It is minimum between them (at parallel of origin &#8776; 30S) and increases away from this parallel. Therefore, scale at 10S > scale at 30S, and scale at 50S > scale at 30S.

Scale contracts between standard parallels and expands outside them. 10S is outside, 50S is outside. 30S is between. Scale at 10S will be larger than at 30S. Scale at 50S will be larger than at 30S. The question might be asking for the scale relative to 30S. Scale factor is 1 at standard parallels. It is minimum between them (at parallel of origin &#8776; 30S) and increases away from this parallel. Therefore, scale at 10S > scale at 30S, and scale at 50S > scale at 30S. The checkmark is A, implying scale at 10S is smaller. This contradicts the properties of a Lambert chart. There might be an error in the question or checkmark.)"
