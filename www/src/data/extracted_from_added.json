Self-correction:\r\nThe provided answer B is 67 NM. Let's re-evaluate. Maybe the 10NM before is\r\nalready included in the question's premise of needing to calculate the start\r\npoint distance.  No, the question asks  at what distance FROM the VOR .\r\nThe distance  covered  during descent is 66.7 NM. Need to arrive at FL50\r\nat 10NM  before  VOR. So start descent at 66.7 + 10 = 76.7 NM. The\r\nprovided answer B=67NM seems incorrect based on the calculation. Let's assume\r\nthe question meant 10NM  after  the VOR, then 66.7 - 10 = 56.7NM (D).\r\nLet's assume the question meant 10NM  is the total distance required  -\r\nimpossible. Let's recheck rate of descent needed: (250 kt / 60 min/hr) * (1250\r\nft/min) / (20000 ft) is not useful here. Stick with the time calculation. It's\r\npossible there's an error in the question or the provided answer key. Based on\r\nthe calculation 76.7 NM is the correct distance FROM the VOR to start descent.\r\nIf we assume the answer B (67 NM) is correct, it implies a descent distance of\r\n57 NM, which would take 57 / (250/60) = 13.68 mins, requiring a RoD of 20000 /\r\n13.68   1462 ft/min.
